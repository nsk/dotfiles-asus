Richard "Ribbs" Gibbs was the keyboard player for the New Wave band Oingo Boingo from 1980 to 1984. He was also a session player, performing on over 150 albums for artists as diverse as War, Tom Waits, Robert Palmer, and Aretha Franklin. He also started the band Zuma II, which had an eponymously titled record released by Pasha/CBS Records. He has appeared live with Korn, The Staples, Chaka Khan, and Oingo Boingo.

Like his former bandmate Danny Elfman, Gibbs has embarked on a life of scoring movies and television shows. He has written the scores for over fifty films (Dr. Dolittle, Step Into Liquid, Say Anything and Queen of the Damned, among others) and acted as musical director and composer for various television shows, including Muppets Tonight!, The Simpsons, and the Battlestar Galactica miniseries.

He most recently worked with the indie-pop band Eisley, recording and producing their second full-length album Combinations at his Woodshed studio in September of 2006.
